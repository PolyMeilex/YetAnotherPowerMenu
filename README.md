### Why do we need yet another power menu?
The answer is really simple... we don't,
but I really like the idea of native power menu with CSS support so here you go anyway

In its final form, it is supposed to integrate well with [YetAnotherBar](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/YetAnotherBar), but for now, it is just a standalone power menu, I'll think about integrations later
